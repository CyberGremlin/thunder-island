**Who am I?**

Hi!

My name is Alex.

It’s short for Alexandra. I tell you this only because usually everyone wants to know. But, if you call me Alexandra, I will probably look behind me for this mysterious person.  

This website is my space, my hobby, my pride, my obsession. I’m the designer, coder, author, teacher and recipe maker behind everything - and I mean everything. UI design, architecture, coding on the front and back end, English explanations and the exercises as well as the photography, content and writing. It's a great way to showcase everything I've done as well as practice and perfect the new. Okay, I admit the food photography totally sucks but I can't fake it or take too long because it truly is just food - we actually eat it for dinner afterwards. 

I was born and bred in Yorkshire in the north of England where I met and married my husband, Carl. Together we moved to the tiny Mediterranean island of Malta.

Fifteen years later, we are still here living the ex-pat life but now with two kids, Isla and Taran. Isla wants to be a princess vlogger, while Taran believes all zombies wear one shoe and wishes every day was Halloween.
