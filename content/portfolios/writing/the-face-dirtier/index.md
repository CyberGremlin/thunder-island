# The Face Dirtier

## A Poem of Play

> The Face Dirtier is out there day after day,
> He watches and waits until I go play.
>
>I told my mum I would keep my face clean,
>But he was waiting out there, hidden and unseen.
>
>He was ready for mischief as I ran outside,
>I couldn’t avoid him, ‘though I really tried!
>
>In the puddle where I jumped,
>There was mud that he dumped.
>
>In the big tree that I climbed,
>He left a bug trail; he slimed.
>
>In the bushes where I scrambled
>He left dirt on the brambles.
>
>When I got home, my mum could see,
>The ginormous mess he had made of me.
>
>She laughed so much as she sent me to bath,
>And giggled so hard as she cleaned my dirt path.
>
>I don’t understand why grown-ups can’t see,
>It’s the Face Dirtier who does it. It’s really not me!
