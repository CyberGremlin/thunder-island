## Recipe

### Ingredients

  - 2 medium eggs
  - 2 medium rashers bacon
  - ½ tbsp ghee

### Instructions

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Melt the ghee in a medium frying pan that is large enough for the two eggs on the hob at a medium heat. (I use number 5.)
  - **Step 2**
    - When the ghee is heated, crack the eggs one at a time into separate areas of the pan, don't worry if the whites mix together.
    - Place a cover over the frying pan – you can balance the lid from a saucepan on top if your frying pan doesn't have one. The important thing is to keep the air over the top of the eggs heated. 
    - Set a timer for 5 minutes.
  - **Step 3**
    - Place the bacon onto a microwaveable plate and microwave to desired 'doneness'. 
    (I prefer 3½ mins at 900 watts, this gives me nicely cooked bacon with crispy edges. My husband prefers 3 mins at 900 watts because he doesn't like the crispy edges. The choice is yours.)
  - **Step 4**
    - When the timer pings on the eggs. Check them. They should be nicely cooked, with soft liquid yolks. If not, leave them another minute and recheck.
  - **Step 5**
    - Serve everything together on the plate.
