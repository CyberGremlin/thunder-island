## Recipe

### Ingredients

  - 6 medium sausages (or 4 large or 10 small)
  - 200g (2 cups) almond flour
  - 2 medium eggs
  - 1½ tbsp butter or ghee
  - ¼ tsp salt

### Instructions

#### Method

  - **Step 1**
    - Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 175°C (or 350°F).
    - Line a baking tray with baking paper.
  - **Step 2**
    - Mix the almond flour, eggs, 1½ tbsp of butter salt together to form a sticky pastry.
    - Divide the pastry into 6 parts. (See photos.)
  - **Step 3**
    - Take two squares of clingfilm. 
    - Lay one square down.
    - Roll one part of the pastry into a cylinder and place it on the clingfilm.
    - Lay the second square of clingfilm over the pastry.
    - Use your rolling pin to roll over the top of the second clingfilm until the pastry is big enough to wrap around a sausage, plus an extra 2cm (about ¾ inch) to form a lip.
    - Remove the top layer of clingfilm, and place your sausage at one edge.
    - Use the clingfilm at the bottom to smooth the pastry around the sausage.
    - When the pastry is wrapped around the sausage, pick up the sausage and smooth the lip of pastry over the other side to keep the pastry sealed.
    - Place the sausage roll onto the baking paper.
    - Continue until all the sausages are done.
  - **Step 4**
    - Bake in the centre of the oven for 30 mins. 
    - Turn over half way through.
  - **Step 5**
    - Serve hot or cold.

## About Keto Sausage Rolls Without Cheese

Keto Sausage Rolls without Cheese is a post which involves a lot more photos than I usually take.  This is because it was easier to convey the sausage roll making process that way.  I wrote out the method step by step, but it wasn’t as clear without the photos. 

What I do want to get across is that however it might look at first, once you get the hang of it, it’s pretty straightforward. 

Now, I can bang out six sausage rolls within 10 minutes from start to finish.  After that, I just put everything in the oven and forget about it till the timer pings.


### Making Keto Tasty Sausage Rolls without Cheese Step by Step

- #### Divide the Keto Pastry First

This recipe is just enough for 10 small sausages or 6 medium-sized sausages, or 4 large sausages.  There is little to nothing left over.  So, divide the pastry into these amounts first.  That way, you don’t use too much or too little and end up with a problem one sausage from the end.  I eyeball it, but if you aren’t sure, weigh it out instead, whatever is easiest for you.

- #### How to Roll the Sausage Rolls

Next, cut two small squares of clingfilm. (I believe in America, this is called plastic wrap or saran wrap.) Lay one square down on a flat surface. Roll one portion of the pastry between your hands into an oblong shape. Place it onto the clingfilm. Place the other piece of clingfilm on top.

A small side note on this for those thinking of ditching this step – the clingfilm is necessary. Until I included the clingfilm, it was a torturous nightmare trying to get the pastry to stick to the sausage and not the rolling pin. And, till now, I haven’t been able to think of another way to make this recipe that doesn’t involve clingfilm.

- #### Rolling the Pastry Between the Clingfilm 

Then, use a rolling pin and roll it out to roughly the width of your sausage, long enough to wrap around the sausage plus about 1-2 cm extra in length.  The spare is because the pastry will contract a bit when baking. If you don’t have that extra, it will pull apart.  However, if it does, it will still taste just as fabulous but we can still aim for aesthetically pleasing just to impress.  Trim the extra pastry with a knife, pull it away and add it to another portion instead.

- #### Rolling

Once you are confident in the size and shape of the pastry you’ve rolled, place your sausage at one end and roll it around the sausage. Use the clingfilm to do this, or else the pastry will stick to your hands. Finally, press down a little on your pastry seam to seal the sausage roll.

Transfer your newly rolled Keto Tasty Sausage Roll without Cheese onto a lined baking tray. Then, rinse and repeat. 

- ### Ingredient Alternatives

- ##### Sausages

Now for sausages, low carb dieters like keto and Atkins’ Maintenance have a bit more variety when it comes to their sausages, that is, as long as they count the carbs.  Most of the cheap and cheerful frozen sausages in my local shops come in at 3g total carbs.  Keto sausages are becoming more available too, with less than 1g of carbs per sausage.

Those eating paleo, you have to search about a bit. Still, with more and more people coming to the conclusion that gluten messes up their body, the more the industry giants are falling in line. As a result, the choice of traditional foods with clean living ingredients is increasing.  Power to people!

Also, I’m going to spill a well-kept secret. It’s something many people don’t realise because they go to the bigger faceless supermarkets.  But, your local butcher can often make you sausages on request minus all the rubbish you can’t tolerate.

- ###### The Maltese Sausage

I’m going to do a little plug here for one of the traditional foods of my adopted country, Malta.  The Maltese sausage.  While sausages from other countries and even from different counties in England have become famous worldwide, not many people have heard of the Maltese sausage.  When made authentically, it is a truly paleo sausage. Traditionally, it contains only pork and herbs. There are no additives, preservatives or breading of any kind, just meat, herbs and spices, and that’s it. They are different, so keep that in mind – very peppery and spicy and quite large too.

- #### Ghee

As anyone who goes through my recipes knows, I use ghee over butter because of the lactose content contained in butter. Still, to keep things a little cheaper, you can switch to butter if you wish.  I honestly have not tried this recipe with any other fats available, so I cannot comment on using anything else.  But, if you find a more strict paleo alternative, tell us in the comments so we can share the healthiness.

- ### Reheating

These sausage rolls taste great cold and also reheated.  One minute in the microwave gets it to piping hot.  At the moment, these sausage rolls are my husband, Carl’s, favourite at-work lunch. He says they are so filling he can eat one for brunch, and it lasts him all day at work till dinnertime.
