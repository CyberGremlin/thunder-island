    content: `‘Cos Comfort Food Is Awesome! Keto Cottage Pie is another recreation of those previously unhealthy recipes I grew up with.Now revamped into a new healthy version. My resident taste- tester, aka my husband, Carl, declared. “Oo! It’s really nice. What did you do?” And, with such praise, this recipe became a keeper.
    As you might be able to guess, due to the free use of cheeses, this particular British classic comfort pie is best suited to keto and Atkins’ dieters.It was made to be low carb.Other than the taste- essential inclusion of onion and a stock cube, because the beef would be too bland without them, all other usual veggies have been removed.This means we can use cauliflower instead of potatoes for the topping, and it’s still relatively low in carbs.This dish is all about the topping!
    I don’t recommend this recipe without the cheeses, so for paleo, paleo - ish or whole30, take a look at the Healthy Whole30 Shepherd’s Pie instead.
    So, what's a cottage pie? The British have made an art form out of pies.  If you think of those quintessentially British foods, yes, there is the bangers and mash, fish and chips, but we excel at our pie variety. Who says British food is boring?
    Historically, the cottage pie was a pie of any meat topped with potatoes.  After their introduction to English cuisine, potatoes, being easy to grow and cheap, became a fast staple of home-cooking in houses of the poor. The poor of Britain at the time lived in cottages. Hence, the cottage pie.
    Over time we obviously like to know what meat is in our pie before tasting it. A lamb cottage pie became a shepherd’s pie instead because shepherd’s take care of sheep, which left cottage pie to be used freely for beef while a pie with fish inside became, quite sensibly, fisherman’s pie.
    Throughout Britain, cooks have their traditional, often proudly announced (we aren’t a very secretive bunch, to be honest), special pie herb set. At the same time, the veggies tend to be what’s in the kitchen and available to use, probably because it’s raining outside and we don’t want to go to the shops!"`
