-**Step 1**
Melt the ghee in large frying pan over a medium high heat. (I use number 7.)
When it is heated add the pork and fry for 3 minutes, flip the pork over and fry for another 3 minutes. The pork should be just cooked and the juices run clear. Remove the pork and cover.

Stir often until the onion becomes translucent, about 7 minutes.
Add the paprika, cumin, salt and pepper and stir in for 1 minute.
